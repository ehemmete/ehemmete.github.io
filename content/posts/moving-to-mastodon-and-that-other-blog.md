Like many others I'm fed up with what is going on at Twitter and closed my account. I was never much of a poster, but I did like keeping up with news (primarily #macadmin) there. So I've moved to Mastodon. Turns out I had created an account on mastodon.social a few years ago, so I am now [over there](https://mastodon.social/@ehemmete) for my social media needs.

Also I don't post here much anymore. Anything I do for work goes to the [RSKGroup blog](https://www.rskgroup.org/blog/) and that takes most of my blogging time/energy.
