We are testing a 90-day trial of Promise's [FileCruiser](http://www.promise.com/us/Products/FileCruiser).  It is a private Dropbox look-a-like.  We have been pretty happy with how it works and the performance.  One tricky part is occasionally I have had to try to find the files in the filesystem. If you need to find the data in FileCruiser, it is stored in folders named by a UUID number in `/mnt/UserData/MongaStorage/tenants/<UUID>/home/.`
