I just had a student in class ask about a keyboard shortcut for System Preferences.  There isn't one built-in, but we can make one. Open System Preferences and select the Keyboard panel.  Then select the Shortcuts tab.  On the left choose the App Shortcuts entry and click the plus sign below the box on the right.

Click Add.[![Screen Shot 2013-11-06 at 10.11.41 AM](http://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-06-at-10-11-41-am.png?w=300)](http://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-06-at-10-11-41-am.png) I chose option-command-comma since command-comma is used for application preferences. Now from anywhere, you should be able to type your keyboard shortcut to open System Preferences.
