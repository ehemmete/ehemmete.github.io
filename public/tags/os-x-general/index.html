<p>Thanks for writing this article and it is really helpful. I am trying to distribute ciscoanyconnect app to our Intune managed mac devices. The cisco package we have includes all components like posture, AMP, websecurity etc. I&rsquo;d like to exclude all of them except VPN using choice.xml. I followed your post and after I built the package it fails to run. I suspect there is some issue with the postinstall script. please assist me here.</p>

      <p>In a <a href="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/2017/07/26/using-installer-choices-xml-to-modify-anyconnect-and-mcafee-deployments/">previous article</a>, I discussed creating a choices.xml file to control what gets installed by a vendor package.  I briefly touched on how to use the choices.xml file, but don&rsquo;t give much detail.  In this post, I will spell out how to put the vendor package and choices.xml file in a wrapper package for deployment through anything that handles packages. For my example, I will be using Cisco&rsquo;s AnyConnect 4.8 package and a choices.xml file to only install the VPN portion.  Using <a href="http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html">Stéphane Sudre&rsquo;s Packages</a> application, create a new raw package project. <img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-17-at-12.38.06-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-03-17 at 12.38.06 PM"> Give it a useful name and decide where to save the project. <img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-17-at-12.38.24-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-03-17 at 12.38.24 PM">You can set Settings how you like, but the defaults generally work for what we are doing. Everything in this exercise will be in the Scripts tab. <img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-17-at-12.58.09-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-03-17 at 12.58.09 PM">Drag the AnyConnect.pkg and your choices.xml to the Additional Resources area.  You can name your xml file anything you want.  For example, I have choicesForAnyConnectVPN.xml and choicesForAnyConnectUmbrella.xml for 2 different package projects.  For AnyConnect, I also want to install our vpn configuration, so I add a Profiles folder with the vpn folder and the configuration in there. <img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-17-at-12.57.51-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-03-17 at 12.57.51 PM"> My company&rsquo;s VPN requires a certificate, so that is added as well.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-17-at-1.38.57-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-03-17 at 1.38.57 PM.png"> The AnyConnect.pkg already looks for the Profiles directory in the same directory as the package. Now we need a post installation script to tell the installer binary to use our choices.xml file.  The first step is to find the path to the resources area, which is created by the installer process and cleaned up automatically.  The post install script will be running from that directory, so we can find the path with <code>​dirname</code>.  Then we tell installer about the choices.xml, the vendor package, and the target volume.  Lastly, I add the certificate to the System Keychain. <a href="https://gist.github.com/ehemmete/70396684d6ed91687ec4b7f85aa8961b">https://gist.github.com/ehemmete/70396684d6ed91687ec4b7f85aa8961b</a> Once the postinstall.sh is created, drag it to the Post-installation well, save your package, and build it. <img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/screen-shot-2020-03-17-at-1.39.44-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-03-17 at 1.39.44 PM.png">I then <a href="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/2016/11/04/signing-installer-packages-with-automator/">sign my packages</a> with a certificate from my company&rsquo;s Apple developer account. Lastly, a note about the target for <code>installer</code>. You could put <code>/</code> in for the target, but if there is a chance this package will be installed while booted from something other than the internal drive (much more common in the era of imaging), the package will be installed to the boot volume, not the correct target.  Using <code>$3</code> means put it on the target volume.  Rich Trouton mentions it under Installer Script Variables <a href="https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2014/06/01/understanding-payload-free-packages/">here</a>.  There are also mentions in the old PeachPit <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=H3awpzaO7IwC&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=%243%20The%20mount%20point%20of%20the%20destination%20volume&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q=$3%20The%20mount%20point%20of%20the%20destination%20volume&amp;f=false">Mac OS X Deployment</a> book.  [edit]And thanks to <a href="https://scriptingosx.com">Scripting OS X</a> for the pointer to double quote <code>$3</code> in the post install script.  In these cases (where it isn&rsquo;t <code>/</code>) it will likely expand to <code>/Volumes/Macintosh HD/</code>​ and the space will cause a problem if not quoted.  He also points out that I hard coded the path to the System Keychain, but<code>security</code> won&rsquo;t be happy if <code>$3</code> isn&rsquo;t <code>/</code>, so this isn&rsquo;t as flexible as I intended.</p>

<p>Thanks for the example. I have a similar challenge, getting a one window gui for applescipt. Just want to confirm that you are using Swift to generate text files and then running Applescript to get the data from the text files and running the real work on the targeted application. Is the Applescript being run separately,(called by the user) or is the Applescript call coming from within the Swift program?</p>

      <p>There was recently a discussion in #bash in the <a href="https://macadmins.org">MacAdmin Slack</a> about better ways to handle multiple dialogs for gathering info from users or techs.  In my company&rsquo;s provisioning process we want to collect a number of things to be picked up by our inventory system (BigFix).  This started with a set of AppleScript Display Dialogs.</p>

<p>This is not a great experience and gets worse as we try to make it less error prone (do you see the mistake?). To make this better for our techs, I wrote a relatively simple Swift application.  I didn&rsquo;t/don&rsquo;t have much Swift experience (just playing around in Playgrounds, a few simple tutorials), so I can&rsquo;t say this is the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to do this, but it works for me/our process.</p>

      <p>I often use List View in the Finder for the directory where I organize all my packages.  There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any way to create a folder within the highlighted folder below.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-23-at-4-48-33-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-03-23 at 4.48.33 PM.png"> In this post I will show how we can create that option.  Right-click/Control-click doesn&rsquo;t have a New Folder option in this view.  The File menu/Action menu/keyboard shortcut for New Folder makes a the new folder in the folder that is at the root of the window.  That doesn&rsquo;t work for me since there are so many folders in this directory that I lose my place. We can use AppleScript to make a new folder and Automator to make it a Service that will be available in the right-click menu.  Open Automator and choose to make a New Document and Choose to make it a Service.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-23-at-4-56-03-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-03-23 at 4.56.03 PM.png"> Then search on the left for Run.  Drag a Run AppleScript action into the workflow on the right.  Then change the dropdowns to &ldquo;Service receives selected folders in Finder&rdquo;<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-23-at-4-58-57-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-03-23 at 4.58.57 PM.png"> The AppleScript block will be passed the folder we have selected in the Finder as <code>input</code>.  We can use that to know where to make our new folder.  We could just use:<code>tell application &quot;Finder&quot; make new folder at input end tell</code>to make a new folder, but then we have to rename it.  Since we are already using AppleScript, I decided to prompt for the name up front.  So my final AppleScript looks like```
on run {input, parameters}
set folderNameDialog to display dialog &ldquo;Enter the folder name:&rdquo; default answer &quot;&quot; buttons {&ldquo;OK&rdquo;} default button &ldquo;OK&rdquo;
set folderName to text returned of folderNameDialog
tell application &ldquo;Finder&rdquo;
make new folder at input with properties {name:folderName}
end tell
return input
end run</p>

<p>Heyas - it looks like you might be using Jamf from the last screenshot (jamfhelper?). If you&rsquo;re running Jamf Pro 10, you could put the installer policy in Self Service and get a URL that opens Self Service and runs that policy automatically: <a href="http://docs.jamf.com/10.0.0/jamf-pro/administrator-guide/Making">http://docs.jamf.com/10.0.0/jamf-pro/administrator-guide/Making</a>_Items_Available_to_Users_in_Jamf_Self_Service_for_macOS.html There&rsquo;s a section on that page; Item URLs An AppleScript with: do shell script &ldquo;open &quot; might work (haven&rsquo;t tested but would be really interested).</p>

      <p>I was recently asked to create a shortcut on our users&rsquo; Desktops to kick off the High Sierra install. We are caching the installer through our management system. In the past I have created a shortcut to the installer on their Desktop, but that required them to click through the many continue buttons. This method will use the startosinstall script from <a href="https://github.com/bp88/JSS-Scripts/blob/master/OS_Upgrade.sh">Slack member @bp</a> to start the install with minimal user interaction. I wrap that shell script (with the appropriate modifications for my environment) in an Automator application, but to have the script run as root, I call it with Run AppleScript using the <code>do shell script ... with administrator privileges</code> form. <img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/automatorinstaller.png" alt="AutomatorInstaller.png"> The full AppleScript is</p>

      <p>[edit] I have written a follow up article explaining how to wrap a vendor package and custom choices.xml in a <a href="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/2020/03/17/creating-a-wrapper-package-for-a-choices-xml-file/">wrapper package</a>.[/edit] I have seen several posts on <a href="https://macadmins.herokuapp.com">MacAdmin Slack</a> asking for help deploying only components of big packages that the business wants or needs.  There are often several ways of handling this.  For example, from the McAfee ePO console, your admin can give you a Threat Prevention only installer instead of the full Endpoint Security package.  That is great if you can grab that yourself or the admin is helpful and able to get it for you.  This isn&rsquo;t always the case.  Another route is to install the full package and then uninstall the pieces that you don&rsquo;t want/need.  The Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility client installer does put uninstall scripts for each piece of the package in /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin.  Both of these options can get your Macs to the end state you want, but they do have potential drawbacks/complications.  Using the Apple provided installer command line tool, we can see what options are available in these packages and then create a file to set which pieces we want.  This does take some work upfront, but we have all the tools we need.   To start we need an installer package that has choices.  We will focus on 2, Cisco&rsquo;s AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 4.3.03086 and McAfee&rsquo;s Endpoint Security for Mac 10.2.1.  The choices show up in the GUI as selectable check boxes. [gallery ids=&ldquo;593,592&rdquo; type=&ldquo;rectangular&rdquo;] To see these choices from the command line and generate the information we need, we use the installer command with the <code>‑showChoicesXML</code> option and pass it the package we are interested in.  Depending on the package, we may also need to specify the target, so I generally always do.  Be careful with the target.  Some installers will behave differently if some or all of the software is already installed. Installing on a clean system (maybe a VM you can role back) is a good way to see the real default behavior. Notice in the Cisco installer picture above, VPN and WebSecurity are unchecked and grayed out.  That is because my target already has those pieces installed on it. Our command is: <code>installer ‑showChoicesXML ‑pkg /path/to/AnyConnect.pkg ‑target /</code> That will print a bunch of information to standard out (the terminal window), so I will often redirect it to a file for saving and easier reading/searching like so: <code>installer ‑showChoicesXML ‑pkg /path/to/AnyConnect.pkg ‑target / &gt; ~/Desktop/anyconnect_choices.xml</code> That will output something like:[gist]542c05e12abb931746cc9811e60fe32d[/gist] Notice the individual dictionaries:[gist]14ad94a01a22cb98a5de9f6f36448247[/gist] This is one of the choices in the package (Umbrella).  Notice that the choiceIsSelected key is set to 1.  This means that by default on this volume (the target from the command), this choice will be installed.  We want to tell the installer command to skip this choice so we want to set choiceIsSelected to 0.  To do that we will create our own xml file that has the values we want.  The keys that we need are the choiceIdentifier, choiceIsSelected, and whether we want the choice to install (set value to 1) or not install (set value to 0).  Our file needs to be valid XML, so we need the appropriate file header.  You can create a valid XML file with the built in defaults command but for this, we can just copy the skeleton of our choices.xml we output from installer.[gist]c7002bd6dba90b136ff48b7a5a3b08eb[/gist] Now we need to add a dictionary for each setting we want to set in this form:[gist]e157915f4e47ce2583eaea71b682cd6d[/gist] We need to match the choiceIdentifier values to the those in the output of the installer command.  This AnyConnect package is setup nicely for easy reading.  Not all packages are (more on that later).  Then we have our choiceAttribute key (the key we want to change from default) set to &lsquo;selected&rsquo; and finally what we want to set that attribute to in the attributeSetting key (in this case we are setting it to 0 so this choice doesn&rsquo;t install). We only need to add entries for things we want to change from the default. In this case the choices file specifies settings for all possible choices. Once we build up our file, we get something like:[gist]8a34f3b7741de31e969e09247b3c31d9[/gist] This file tells <code>installer</code> to install VPN and skip the rest. Now we are ready to test the package.  To first verify that things look like they will work, we can use the <code>‑showChoicesAfterApplyingChangesXML</code> option for installer and see what it will try to do. <code>installer ‑showChoicesAfterApplyingChangesXML /path/to/choicesForAnyConnect.xml ‑pkg /path/to/AnyConnect.pkg ‑target /</code> [gist]9f62ad9b678d20181f6365099c94169c[/gist]In this output we will see more than one entry for each choice.  In this output I have 3, enabled, visible, and selected.  Enabled means will the choice be allowed to be changed in the GUI and visible means will it even show up in the GUI.  We are only worried about selected as we aren&rsquo;t going to use the GUI.  So confirm that the choices we want to install have selected set to 1 and the choices we want to skip have selected set to 0. Once that all looks correct, we can actually deploy with <code>‑applyChoiceChangesXML</code>.  That looks like <code>installer ‑applyChoiceChangesXML /path/to/choicesForAnyConnect.xml ‑pkg /path/to/AnyConnect.pkg ‑target /</code> This can be packaged up for deployment through a management tool pretty easily.  Basically you want to put the default package and your choices.xml into the packages resources area and then have a post install script that runs the above command.  There is a lot more detail possible, but that might be another blog post. Cisco&rsquo;s AnyConnect Secure Mobility installer is pretty friendly when it comes to repackaging/making choices.  If we try to apply the above to the McAfee Endpoint Security 10.2.1 installer, we will see some additional complexity. <code>installer ‑showChoicesXML ‑pkg /path/to/McAfee_Endpoint_Security\ 10.2.1/1\ Source/McAfee-Endpoint-Security-for-Mac-10.2.1-RTW-standalone-2632.pkg ‑target /</code> [gist]6c976037049b701741deb01bce7c660d[/gist] Notice that the choiceIdentifier is the not so helpful installer_choice_5.  We can still see what the choice is by the choiceTitle, but now when we create our choices.xml, we need to be very careful about which choices we are selecting and which we are not.  Your end result will look something like: [gist]c4cb8ef55ce6e11b108fa6a51e48c385[/gist] In this file, installer_choice_5 is the Firewall and installer_choice_6 is Web Control. For this type of package it can be important to save the output of showChoicesXML as a reference for which choice is which. This is an example of only putting in dictionaries for the choices we want to change.  I would say this is probably not a best practice as different systems can end up with different defaults, but it can work.</p>

      <p>Apple packages (.pkgs) are opened by the GUI Installer.app or the command line installer command. If a package is unsigned and gets a quarantine flag (from being transferred over a network), the GUI Installer will refuse to run it.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-02-at-3-07-35-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-11-02 at 3.07.35 PM.png"> We can get around that with a right-click -&gt; Open, but we shouldn&rsquo;t be training computer users to ignore security warnings like this. <img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-04-at-4-49-33-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-11-04 at 4.49.33 PM.png"> If you are creating your own packages, and users or techs may run them manually, then you really should be signing them. Even if you are deploying them in a way that a person won&rsquo;t see a warning, signing packages can be very easy and provide a check that nothing changed since you created it. See below the break for how to easily automate signing packages. I use <a href="http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html">WhiteBox Packages</a> to create most of my packages. It has a built in feature to sign packages it builds, but recent versions have had some problems with it and when it works it still has to be set per package project. The Apple provided tool to sign our packages is <code>productsign</code>. This works, but to make things easier on myself, I have wrapped that up in an Automator application that I can use as a droplet. The basic format for using productsign is <code>productsign [options] --sign identity input-product-path output-product-path</code> Interestingly, the man page for productsign doesn&rsquo;t show any available options. So next we want to <code>--sign</code> using <code>identity</code>. This is our Developer ID Installer certificate from Apple&rsquo;s developer program. This does require a paid membership, but if you work for an organization supporting Macs, there is plenty of benefit to offset the $99 or $399/year (signing identities, early access to OS builds for testing, etc). To sign packages we need a Developer ID Installer (see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingCertificates/MaintainingCertificates.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH31-SW6">Apple&rsquo;s documentation</a>) Once you have your Dev ID Installer certificate installed in your keychain, then we can get the appropriate reference for it. Open /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access. Search for Developer ID and select the appropriate certificate. Then you can highlight and copy the name.  If you are a part of more than one developer program, select the &ldquo;right&rdquo; one here.  You can create several Automator applications if you want to have one for each ID.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-02-at-3-25-14-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-11-02 at 3.25.14 PM.png"> So now we can write our command <code>productsign --sign 'Developer ID Installer: OrgName (Code)' in_pkg out_pkg</code>. For example <code>productsign --sign 'Developer ID Installer: OrgName (Code)' ~/Development/Unsigned.pkg ~/Development/Signed.pkg</code>. This will prompt to allow productsign access to your keychain. Say Allow or Always Allow.<code>$ productsign --sign 'Developer ID Installer: OrgName (Code)' ~/Desktop/Unsigned/build/Unsigned.pkg ~/Desktop/Unsigned/build/Signed.pkg productsign: using timestamp authority for signature productsign: signing product with identity &quot;Developer ID Installer: OrgName (Code)&quot; from keychain /Users/username/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db productsign: adding certificate &quot;Developer ID Certification Authority&quot; productsign: adding certificate &quot;Apple Root CA&quot; productsign: Wrote signed product archive to /Users/username/Desktop/Unsigned/build/Signed.pkg</code>Now when we run the installer by double clicking it, the installer opens. Notice the lock in the upper right corner. Click the clock and we can examine the certificate chain back to Apple&rsquo;s Root.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-02-at-3-29-14-pm1.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-11-02 at 3.29.14 PM.png"> The idea when we started was to make this easy to do since we might need to sign a lot of packages over time. To automate this, open /Applications/Automator.app. Choose to create a New Document. Then choose Application for the type and click Choose.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-02-at-3-31-43-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-11-02 at 3.31.43 PM.png"> Search for shell in the Actions name search field. Drag a run shell script action to the workflow.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-02-at-3-32-11-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-11-02 at 3.32.11 PM.png"> First adjust the Pass input: pop up to as arguments.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-02-at-3-33-00-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-11-02 at 3.33.00 PM.png"> That will fill in the template for us. Then enter our productsign command with some slight differences. The <code>--sign</code> and <code>identity</code> will be the same, but now for the input and output, we need to make this work with whatever is dropped on the application. The packages will be passed as arguments and the for loop will work on each one in turn. These will be assigned to the pkg variable, so that becomes our input file. Then for the output, I settled on packagename.signed.pkg to differentiate the output from the input. This <code>$(sed 's/.pkg$/.signed.pkg/g' &lt;&lt;&lt; $pkg)</code> will find the last &lsquo;.pkg&rsquo; in the filename and replace it with &lsquo;.signed.pkg&rsquo;, while keeping the name portion the same (see note at the end for how this works) .  Notice I also changed the <code>f</code> to <code>pkg</code> just to make it clear what the variable represents.```

Some background on my use case for this.  The company I work for has ~15,000 Windows computers in use bound to AD.  When a user logs in, a GPO runs a batch file hosted on the domain controller&rsquo;s file share.  The batch file is basically a large case statement<code>if in group A; then     mount shares X and Y if in group B; then     mount share Z</code>I wanted to provide our Mac users with a similar experience.  Read how below the break. Our Macs are not bound to Active Directory and we have historically had password confusion issues with network vs local passwords and keychain sync issues.  To help this we have setup Apple&rsquo;s excellent <a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=17757">Enterprise Connect</a> to help with that. When a Mac user is logged in and is on a network that can connect to our domain controllers (internal, VPN, etc), Enterprise Connect automatically retrieves a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket for the user and, optionally, confirms that the local password is in sync with the user&rsquo;s AD password and prompts the user to fix things if necessary.  Enterprise Connect can also mount file shares including the user&rsquo;s home folder.  This is handled on a per user basis or by profile.  This works great if the user wants to mount a share they use, but it doesn&rsquo;t scale well across many locations and OUs. One of the other benefits of Enterprise Connect is that it can run scripts based on a couple of triggers including a successful connection (i.e. the Mac is on the right network and a valid TGT has been granted).  Note that Enterprise Connect can only run shell scripts this way. The script to run can be configured in the preference file or via profile with the key/value pair:<code>connectionCompletedScriptPath /Library/Scripts/LogonFileShareMounter.wrapper.sh</code>This script is stored locally on the client system and is what calls the script that will do the actual mounting.  Before that though, we first make sure that we have the current version of the mounting script by checking an embedded serial number (similar to how DNS primary/secondaries work).  The master copy of the mounting script is hosted on the same share as the Windows batch file.  This way it can be updated whenever the Windows version is.  As long as the serial number is updated, the Mac clients will get the updated version next time they successfully connect with Enterprise Connect. <a href="https://gist.github.com/ehemmete/618c96dc364d8a40723e30692617d2a8">https://gist.github.com/ehemmete/618c96dc364d8a40723e30692617d2a8</a> The script starts by creating a directory if necessary and then mounting the file share where the master script is kept.  The <code>mount_smbfs</code> line authenticates to the share with the Kerberos TGT  from Enterprise Connect.  Then as long as the master script can be found, the local serial is compared to the remote version.  If the remote is newer, it is copied in place of the local copy.  Then the share is unmounted and the local copy of the script is run. <a href="https://gist.github.com/ehemmete/2f893815bd03d96d89855feb4e9b7237">https://gist.github.com/ehemmete/2f893815bd03d96d89855feb4e9b7237</a> This script starts with the serial number that is compared against the master copy.  Then the part between the ### lines comes straight from MacAdmin Slack member and frequent gist&rsquo;er Froger/pudquick/MikeyMikey.  His <a href="https://gist.github.com/pudquick/1362a8908be01e23041d">gist</a> is referenced in the script and provides a python function for mounting network shares easily and in such as way that the system treats them the same as the Connect to Server dialog box. Then we get the user&rsquo;s local account name, which in my environment is the same as their Active Directory name, and use <code>ldapsearch</code> to find their group memberships.  Next we need to clean up the output.  At the end we have an array of names of the groups this user is a member of.  Now we start a case-like statement similar to the Window counter part.```

      <p>It has been common for Macs to be bound to Active Directory for a variety of reasons.  Recently, the trend has been to move away from binding due to password/lock out issues, the rise of cloud based services, and SSO options that are more comprehensive of the services users need. With the move away from binding, one thing we lose is the ability to look up user and group data with <code>dscl</code>. Here is a decent primer on <code>dscl</code>: http://www.macos.utah.edu/documentation/authentication/dscl.html (just replace every instance of netinfo with dslocal in your mind). With this move we need another tool to query for information and <code>ldapsearch</code> can do this for us.  There are a lot of ways to use <code>ldapsearch</code> depending on your end goal.  This post will discuss getting user data out of an Active Directory server.  In a future post I hope to explain how I am using this to mount the appropriate file shares for users based on their group membership. The basic format for ldapsearch is to tell it where to search, with what account to search, what to search for, and what data to return from any matches.  A common search I use is:<code>ldapsearch -LLL -H &quot;ldap://${adURL}&quot; -b &quot;${searchbase}&quot; &quot;(&amp;(objectCategory=Person)(objectClass=User)(sAMAccountName=$endUser))&quot; memberOf</code>We start with the command, of course.  Then the <code>-LLL</code> tells the command to limit the output.  I find this gives less output to clean out before I get what I want.  The man page says:<code>**\-L**     Search  results  are  display in LDAP Data Interchange Format detailed in **ldif**(5).  A single **\-L** restricts the output to LDIFv1. A second **\-L** disables comments.  A third **\-L** disables printing of the LDIF version.  The defaultis to use an extended version of LDIF.</code>Then we need to tell ldapsearch where to search.  There are a few parts to this.  The first is the <code>-H</code> option with an ldapuri which will often be the DNS name of the domain controller you want to search on in the form &ldquo;ldap://my.domain.com&rdquo;.  (This can generally be found with <code>host -t SRV _ldap._tcp.my.domain.com</code>).  If you have multiple DCs, you can search more than one, but I normally pick a close one to search.  Then <code>-b</code> specifies the search base to start the search from.  I use the root of the LDAP structure, but if you know where your data is going to be you can be more specific.  This will be in the form <code>&quot;dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;OU=Computers,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com&quot;</code>. Next we need to tell ldapsearch who to search as.  In my command above, I don&rsquo;t make it explicit, but the default is to check for a kerberos ticket granting ticket and use that for authentication.  This works nicely for scripting since there is no password to worry about, but you do need to be sure there will be a TGT when the script/command runs.  Another form of ldapsearch command would be:<code>ldapsearch -LLL -x -H &quot;ldaps://$adURL&quot; -D &quot;${techNameTest}@my.domain.com&quot; -w &quot;$techPW&quot; -b &quot;${searchbase}&quot; &quot;(&amp;(objectCategory=Person)(objectClass=User)(sAMAccountName=$endUser))&quot; memberOf</code>In this search we first tell ldapsearch to use simple (username/password) authentication with the <code>-x</code> option.  Then specify who to search as with <code>-D</code> and the full form should be <code>&quot;user@domain&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;domain\user&quot;</code>.  Then the <code>-w</code> is used to put the password inline with the command.  If there are special characters in the password be sure to wrap it in single quotes; <code>'pa$$W0rd!'</code>.  For one off searches, you can use <code>-W</code> to have the command prompt for the password.  <strong>Also note,when using password base authentication, we should really use ldaps:// in the <code>-H</code> option.  Otherwise the password will be sent across the network in the clear.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-22-at-10-46-17-am1.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-22 at 10.46.17 AM.png">With kerberos authentication the password is not sent across the network at all.</strong> Next we specify what to search for.  In this case I am searching for a user&rsquo;s account, but it could be in many different locations.  We can string filters together using the &ldquo;(&amp;(filter)(filter)(filter)&hellip;)&rdquo; format.  The filters can include a wide range of things.  I am limiting the search based on <code>objectCategory=Person</code>, <code>objectClass=User</code>, and <code>sAMAccountName=first.last</code>.  It turns out I can get away with just using the sAMAccountName if I know exactly who I am looking for.  If we only need one filter, we can use the form &ldquo;(filter)&rdquo;, i.e. <code>&quot;(sAMAccountName=first.last)&quot;</code>. Lastly we tell <code>ldapsearch</code> what data we want back.  This is optional if you want the entire record, but if we just need one piece it is very useful to get that one thing returned.  In this case I am requesting just the <code>memberOf</code> values from the account.  This will tell me the groups this user is a member of. If we put this all together we can get something like this (note you can limit the output further with <code>2&gt;/dev/null</code> , which will redirect the authentication messages which are sent to stderr): [code language=&ldquo;bash&rdquo;]$ldapsearch -LLL -H &ldquo;ldap://dc.my.domain.com&rdquo; -b &ldquo;dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com&rdquo; &ldquo;(sAMAccountName=last)&rdquo; memberOf SASL/GSSAPI authentication started SASL username: <a href="mailto:tech.id@MY.DOMAIN.COM">tech.id@MY.DOMAIN.COM</a> SASL SSF: 112 SASL data security layer installed. dn: CN=Tech.ID,OU=CO,OU=Users,OU=US,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=com memberOf: CN=AM IT Infrastructure Group,OU=Distribution Lists,OU=Exchange,OU=US,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=AM AON IT,OU=Distribution Lists,OU=Exchange,OU=US,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=WebReports_ReadOnly,OU=Groups,OU=US,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=IT - MaaS360 AM Compliance Block,OU=Distribution Lists,OU=Exchange,OU=US,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=AM MFA VPN,OU=Distribution Lists,OU=Exchange,OU=US,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=Configuration Management,OU=Distribution Lists,OU=Exchange,OU=US,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=IT - Lync Users in AM,OU=Distribution Lists,OU=Exchange,OU=US,DC=AM,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=IT - Cisco usCUCMCluster02 Users,OU=Distribution Lists,OU=Exchange,OU=US,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=L\#Contractor,OU=Groups,OU=US,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=SCCDUsers-AM,OU=Global,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=IT - Exchange 365 Users in AM,OU=Distribution Lists,OU=Exchange,OU=US,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=AON IT Contractors (US),OU=Distribution Lists,OU=Exchange,OU=US,DC=AM,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM memberOf: CN=Americas IT Consultants,OU=Distribution Lists,OU=Exchange,OU=US,DC=AM,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM # refldap://DomainDnsZones.AM.DOMAIN.com/DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=MY,DC=DOMAIN,DC=com [/code]</p>

<p>I accidentally changed the ACLs permissions on my home folder and had the same problem on my MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra version 10.12.2 Follow the step below to changed the folders No Access permissions and revert back to Allow access: Restart with the Command and S keys held down, and run the following commands: mount -uw / chown root / chmod 1775 / exit &ndash; After the last command &ldquo;exit&rdquo; your system should restart on its own and everything should appear the same as the time before you changed the Home folder permissions. I hope this helps, Extreme Landing <a href="https://ExtremeLanding.com/">https://ExtremeLanding.com/</a></p>

      <p>[Update 7/20/17] As of 10.12.6 RepairHomePermissions still fails with error: Unable to launch the underlying task process.  Also my bug report has been marked as a  DUPLICATE OF 25393689. [Update 1/26/17] As of 10.12.3 RepairHomePermissions still fails with error: Unable to launch the underlying task process. One of the areas that hasn&rsquo;t gotten much coverage with the update to Sierra is the Recovery HD. This is the minimal OS environment that lets us do things like reinstall the OS, restore a Time Machine backup, and partition volumes before an install. The other thing that Recovery allows us to do is to reset forgotten passwords. Originally, we could do this by booting off the install CD/DVD. Once those went away Recovery HD gave us a Reset Password option in the Utilities menu. That went away in Yosemite(?) but we could get the same functionality by choosing Utilities -&gt; Terminal and running the resetpassword command. This reset password utility would also allow us to reset a users home folder permissions, including the default ACLs. Now with macOS Sierra v10.12, this has changed again. To start, boot to Recovery by holding down Command-R at startup.  You will end up at a screen like: <img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-3-10-31-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-21 at 3.10.31 PM.png"> Then open the Utilities menu and choose Terminal:<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-3-10-55-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-21 at 3.10.55 PM.png"> In the Terminal window that open, run the resetpassword command to bring up a new assistant.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-3-11-11-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-21 at 3.11.11 PM.png"> Select the user you need to reset the password of and click Next. <img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-3-11-28-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-21 at 3.11.28 PM.png"> Then you can enter the new password and confirm it.  Add a hint if you want and click Next.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-3-11-42-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-21 at 3.11.42 PM.png"> Finally you get confirmation of the change and can reboot.  Or if you open the Reset Password menu, you can quit to easily return to the Terminal.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-3-11-57-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-21 at 3.11.57 PM.png"> The piece that is missing from all that is reseting home folder permissions.  It turns out there is a new tool to (try to) do this.  Back in your terminal, enter the command RepairHomePermissions and hit Enter.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-3-12-28-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-21 at 3.12.28 PM.png"> Again an assistant opens and we can select the user whose home folder permissions we need to reset.  Click Next.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-3-12-36-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-21 at 3.12.36 PM.png"> Unfortunately, at this time (Sierra v10.12 build 16A323) the process fails.<img src="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-3-12-41-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-21 at 3.12.41 PM.png"> Again, you can reboot or Quit the RepairHomePermissions assistant (interestingly called ResetPassword in the menu bar). Note that RepairHomePermissions is available in a full Sierra install, but fails even sooner when run as it tries to reference /System/Installation/CDIS/KeyRecoveryAssistant.app/Contents/MacOS/KeyRecoveryAssistant, which doesn&rsquo;t exist on a standard install. Also both of these assistants will have you unlock a FileVaulted drive before asking you which user to work with. Thanks to MacAdmin Slack members mikethefifth, for asking about reseting home folder permissions which prompted these tests, and owen.pragel, for sharing the new command list that included the tantalizing RepairHomePermissions and for finding the reference to KeyRecoveryAssistant. Update: I have filed a bug about RepairHomePermissions not working. https://openradar.appspot.com/28431470</p>

      <p>I have been seeing a lot of noise in my logs about IO80211ScanManager scanning for Wi-Fi networks constantly.  I finally noticed that it was triggered by system_profiler and realized that I was using system_profiler to find my current Wi-Fi network and what channel I was connected to. See the original here: <a href="https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/2014/08/30/network-services-and-ips/">https://sneakypockets.wordpress.com/2014/08/30/network-services-and-ips/</a> So I changed how I find that data in my GeekTool script.  I also took the opportunity to simplify the whole thing a bit more.  Here is the new version: [code language=&ldquo;bash&rdquo;] #! /bin/bash connection=false services=$(networksetup -listallnetworkservices) while read service; do ip=$(networksetup -getinfo &ldquo;$service&rdquo; | grep &ldquo;IP address&rdquo; | grep -v &ldquo;IPv6&rdquo; | awk &lsquo;{print $3}&rsquo;) if [ &ldquo;$ip&rdquo; != &quot;&quot; ]; then echo &ldquo;$service : $ip&rdquo; connection=true if [ &ldquo;$service&rdquo; == &ldquo;Wi-Fi&rdquo; ]; then NetName=$(/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I | grep SSID | grep -v BSSID | cut -d&quot;:&quot; -f2 | tr -d &lsquo;[[:space:]]&rsquo;) Channel=$(/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I | grep channel | cut -d&quot;:&quot; -f2 | tr -d &lsquo;[[:space:]]&rsquo;) echo &ldquo;$NetName / $Channel&rdquo; fi fi done &laquo;&lt;&quot;$services&quot; if [ $connection = false ]; then echo &ldquo;No Connected Services&rdquo; else extIP=$(curl -s <a href="http://checkip.dyndns.org/">http://checkip.dyndns.org/</a> | sed &rsquo;s/[a-zA-Z&lt;&gt;/ :]//g&rsquo;) if [ &ldquo;$extIP&rdquo; != &quot;&quot; ]; then echo &ldquo;External IP: $extIP&rdquo; else echo &ldquo;No External Connection&rdquo; fi fi [/code] Instead of system_profiler the airport command to get the network name and channel.  This stopped the all the message in my logs. I also moved the name and channel logic into the main while read block. This prevents the name and channel from getting separated from the Wi-Fi network IP.</p>

      <p>This may not be as applicable anymore with Mavericks and the new createinstallmedia command, but it was relatively common to make a copy of the OS X Installer media onto a firewire or USB drive to allow for faster installs than from a CD or DVD. One issue with this was always that when the drive is mounted, the Finder would open a window to show the installer.  This was fine if there was only one volume on the drive, you probably wanted it open, but often a drive would have multiple installer partitions and a few bootable partitions and maybe a data partition as well. We don&rsquo;t want any of that to open automatically. The bless command is the way to control if a drive&rsquo;s window is opened automatically.  Replace <em>externaldrive</em> with your volume&rsquo;s name. On a drive that doesn&rsquo;t auto open,</p>
